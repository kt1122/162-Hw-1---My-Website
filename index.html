            Write-up:
            
            For this assignment, I wanted to create something that could fulfill the requirements 
            given but also be useful in my professional life following graduation. I have never
            written in HTML or CSS so there was a bit of a learning curve in getting started with 
            this assignment. I had a hard time figuring out how to make my page responsive, but after
            doing some research as well as looking at other websites HTML online, I was able to figure
            out how to get the page to change based on if it was on a computer or a phone. I also 
            had quite a hard time spacing out the menu at the top of my page. I couldn't get 
            "Home Hobbies Contact" to be evenly spaced out in a responsive way, but then I discovered
            how to set the viewport so that content moved "with-device-width" and that essentially
            fixed all of my problems. I hope to continue improving this webpage in the future and
            turn it into a sort of portfolio that contains information that future employers will
            be interested in seeing like past projects or places I have worked in the industry. 
            That's why I was particularly interested in configuring the "Contact" page to link to my Github. 
            I also made the icons for Github and LinkedIn increase in size when you hover over them as well
            as link them to my Github and LinkedIn when clicked. I also wanted to design my page in a way that
            is professional but not boring, so I used pink which may or may not be an uncommon color to use 
            for a webpage like this, but I think it adds my own personal character to the page.
